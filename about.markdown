I'm freshman at the National University of Singapore (NUS), pursuing a degree in Data Science and Analytics. My academic focus includes statistical analysis, machine learning, data engineering, and computational methods for data-driven decision-making. However, I am also interested in computing, learning other computing languages in my free time.

Currently I'm building proficiency in tools such as Python, R, Swift, SQL and Jekyll, and gaining experience with data visualization, predictive modeling, applied analytics, and app building.

I am open to opportunities and collaborations involving data-driven problem solving, algorithm development, analytical research, or any fun projects.
